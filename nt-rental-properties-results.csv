A modern coin operated laundry facility is available. This is a home away from home, a place you can feel safe and enjoy the Australian lifestyle, and study to the best of your abilities if a student.\n\nLocated on Parkway Avenue near to Bar Beach, this residence property is available to both domestic and international students and offers a great combination of study spaces and opportunity for recreation via fully furnished rooms.\n\nNow, you probably don’t want to spend all of your time indoors do you? During your downtime, you may wish to hang out and enjoy the great outdoors with your roommates and friends. Doing so is a breeze in an area as large and up-tempo as Bar Beach. Catch some rays or play some volleyball at the beach or hop onto the nearby transportation and explore the area on a larger scale. Bar Beach is filled with plenty of great restaurants, cafes and nature to keep you constantly discovering entertaining new facets of the area.\n\nIf this is your first time living away from home, you and your parents likely have a few concerns about security. These concerns should be alleviated by the presence of friendly onsite security and management staff as well as CCTV surveillance.\n\nWe also take the process of interviewing and screening our housing applicants very seriously. We do our best to ensure that we encourage the budding of great friendships by placing people with similar interests and compatible attitudes in the same home.\n\nContact us at Maison Property Management today!!",1,3,0,"['Furnished', 'Cooling', 'Dishwasher']","https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Rooms%20%2F%2046%20Parkway%20Avenue%2C%20COOKS%20HILL;&center=-32.93779,151.76566&zoom=20;","GPS Location: -32.93779, 151.76566",COOKS HILL,NSW,2300,Maison Property,False,True,,2022-10-30 21:26:31
