The suburb is bounded by Northbourne Avenue, Antill Street and Philip Avenue. \n\nThe suburb was gazetted in 1960 and named after Sir John Downer  1844 1915  Premier of South Australia and a member of the first Australian Senate in 1901. There is no specific theme for street names. \n\nThe buildings which make up the Downer community centre and former shops, were built for the CSIRO in 1930s, and the area now comprising Downer was an agricultural research facility for the CSIRO. The area now comprising the suburb was used between 1939 45 as a plantation for the growth of opium poppy to provide a source for medications in the unavailability of imported supplies. The large pine and gum trees which surround the block around the shops were planted in this time as a wind break for the CSIRO building. Large trees  Camden Woolybutts  along Swinden street were also planted then, as Swinden street was the driveway for the CSIRO building, where it connected to Northbourne Avenue.\n\nDisclaimer: \nPlease note that while all care has been taken regarding general information and marketing information compiled for this rental advertisement, LJ HOOKER CANBERRA CITY does not accept responsibility and disclaim all liabilities in regard to any errors or inaccuracies contained herein.

It was named after Edward Kendall Crace an original settler in the Gungahlin area. Streets in Crace are named after parishes and land divisions from colonial times.  It is bounded by the Barton Highway, Gundaroo Drive, Nudurr Drive and Gungahlin Drive. Located in the suburb is the Canberra Nature Park of Gungaderra Grasslands nature reserve. At the 2016 census, it had a population of 4,459.\nThe suburb is under construction, with more than half of the houses completed as of July 2012. Road construction commenced in July 2008. The construction of 21 display homes was completed in May 2009.\nThe ACT government has selected developers for the area as Defence Housing Australia and Canberra Investment Corporation. Expectations are that there will be 1200 houses built over the next six years. The developers are expected to make  60,000,000 but have to share half that with the government. Some very small blocks will be released for low cost housing with 85  released for high cost housing. Eventually the suburb will have 1500 houses on 140 hectares.\n\nWISH TO INSPECT?\n1.

They can be accessed on a Web site called Curtin Living Memories.

It's at the city end of the suburb and very close to Mt Ainslie with easy access to its magic nature reserve. If you're into bushwalking or mountain biking, you're going to love this position. On the other hand, if eating and drinking is more your thing, you've got easy access to the delights of Braddon and the Canberra CBD.\n\nIt's only when you climb the steps to the front door of the home and turn to face the city that you realise just how elevated this position is, with picturesque views to Black Mountain tower and the CBD. The home itself is some 193m2 of living with both front and rear decks and a generous garage underneath. The first thing that you'll notice upon entry are the rich and warm polished Ash floorboards which stretch from the generous entry through the large lounge and dining room. Polished concrete floors add a contemporary feel to part of the extension. There is a family room off the kitchen which opens through lovely cedar doors onto the rear deck and overlooks the in-ground pool, but I think that it will be the sunny lounge and dining room where you will do most of your living. This spacious room also opens out onto the deck and features a lovely outlook to Mt Ainslie. There are 4 bedrooms in all  all with built in robes  although the current owner has utilized one for her private business and this room has its own external access.\n\nBoth bathrooms and the kitchen were renovated in 2006 and the second bathroom has a large shower and underfloor heating. There's ducted gas heating as well as reverse-cycle air conditioning for year-round comfort. The back yard is surrounded by a high hedge, making the pool super private, yet still sunny. The tandem garage has an automatic door and contains a safe and three phase power - ready for the addition of a car charger. There's a circular driveway which is so very useful for easy access and extra off-street parking. The current owner has already downsized and is committed to a sale.\n\nAt a glance;\n  Privately built home with 193m2 of living.\n  Elevated location with views to Black Mountain and Mt Ainslie, and city glimpses.\n  Extension and renovations by renowned architect Anna Pender\n  766m2 block with private and established rear garden.\n  Front and rear hardwood decks\n  In-ground pool\n  Moments from Mt Ainslie nature reserve\n  3-minute drive to Ainslie shops\n  5-minute drive to Canberra CBD\n\nFacts:\nAvailability: Now!\nPets: Tenant's to seek consent from Landlord\nLease Period: 12 months - ending November 2023\nParking: Garage \nCooking: Gas cooking\nEER: 2.5\n\nWISH TO REGISTER YOUR INTEREST?\n1.

An additional outdoor space is the deck located off the living/kitchen area, perfect for your morning coffee.\n\nA well-appointed modern kitchen with electric cooking, Bosch stainless steel dishwasher, plenty of bench and storage options. Three spacious bedroom all with built in robes with the main having mirrored robes, the bathroom comes complete with bathtub, separate shower and vanity and there is also a separate toilet and handbasin located adjacent off the entry.\n\nA huge bonus and energy saving for a young family is the PV (photovoltaic) system is 5.61 kwh and the battery is 13.8 kWh. During the summer the peak production is about 35-40 kwh per day, in the winter it can be as low as 6-8 kwh per day on a rainy overcast day. During the summer with moderate usage as a family of 4 you may not need to pay for electricity bill at all, instead you can earn credits to your accounts by selling back to the grid. With the surging price in energy, the combination of solar system and battery like this will save you heaps of money and no need to wait for the off-peak hours to use the appliances.\nThe hot water is also heated by a passive solar panel, so that will not require any extra electricity during the summer but may need to be boosted with electricity during the winter.\nOverall if you are strategic in usage the extra electricity that you sell back to the grid during the summer months will balance out with the extra grid electricity you use during the winter months. \n\nAt a glance;\n\n• A good size large living space with lots of natural light, wide halls, storage, lock up garage\n• Large master bedroom, would fit a king size bed ,3-door mirrored wardrobe and lots of shelves\n• Second room is queen size with double built in wardrobe\n * Daikin RC wall mounted system in lounge room with electric heating in hallway\n• The bathroom is well appointed with a separate shower and bathtub\n• Laundry is located in the garage\n• A modern kitchen featuring electric cooking and dishwasher\n• Low maintenance gardens front & rear, including established vegetable pods\n• Large Solar System as detailed above-wonderful energy saving features\n\nLocation? It couldn’t get any better! Some of the reasons why location is ideal:\n\n• Located in the newer part of Watson\n• 7 km to the CBD & Braddon\n• Few minutes away from Dickson restaurants and shopping\n* Easy access to major arterial roads such as the Federal Highway easy access heading to Sydney\n* Walking distance to the very popular Epic Farmers Markets & Showground\n• 15-minute drive to the airport\n• Minutes away from Mount Majura nature reserve, ideal for walking, hiking or bike riding\n• EER not available for this property\n\nPlease note-Pets may be considered upon application will need to be approved by owner and processed through the body corporate.\n\nWeekly Rent $650\nRent is payable Fortnightly or per Calendar monthly basis \nFormula – Weekly rent divided by 7 days x 365 divided x 12\nCalendar monthly rent is payable by direct debit\nDisclaimer\n\nWhilst care has been taken in gathering details for properties for lease, we accept no responsibility for any inaccuracies herein.

The postcode is 2913. The suburb is named after George Thomas Palmer  1784 1854  who established a settlement in the Canberra region in 1826 called Palmerville, which was later renamed Ginninderra. It was gazetted on 20 March 1991. Streets are named after mountains and mountain ranges of Australia, with the main street called Kosciuszko Avenue. It is next to the suburbs of Nicholls, Gungahlin, Crace and Franklin. It was the second suburb to be developed in the Gungahlin district, after the industrial suburb of Mitchell. It is bounded by Gungahlin drive and Gundaroo drive.\n\nPalmerston is mainly a residential area with a mix of single homes and duplexes. At the centre of the suburb there are small medical, shopping and community centres. \nPalmerston Primary School opened in 1994 and a large neighbourhood oval is adjacent to the school. A number of cyclepaths cross the suburb, with pedestrian and cycle underpasses at several road crossings. Fruit trees, including plums and apples are scattered along the public thoroughfares of Palmerston. \n\nPalmerston is underlaid by the Canberra Formation from the late middle Silurian age. The area was studied in more detail than many other parts of Canberra by J P Ceplecha from the ANU in 1971.\n\nMostly the Canberra Formation is slaty shale and mudstone. A layer of ashstone has been folded to form 75 meter wide exposures on the surface. These are in the shape of an ear of corn with the major axis pointing north north east. The major axis is determined by an anticline. A syncline determines the western side of the ashstone, with an anticline further to the west. A triangle of siltstone has been lifted up by faults into the western corner of Palmerston. A long fault aligned with the folds follows along the east side of Ginninderra Creek.

He was a leading exponent of the radical inter-war functionalist style that came to Canberra in 1939. The Whitley Houses located in both Griffith and Braddon are listed on the ACT Chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects) Register of Significant Twentieth Century Architecture. The houses are regarded by the RAIA as being excellent examples of the inter–war functionalist style and are some of the first functionalist houses in Australia designed and built by government.\n\n Unit 1 of 3 Burke Crescent Griffith offers the lovely architecture of the period but with modern interiors in keeping with the history of the building.  More like a separate home than an apartment this property has an individual separate entrance and a garden space usually only seen in freestanding homes. \n\nThe interiors are light filled and modern but keeping with the charm of the heritage listed building. All on one level this apartment opens into a large combined kitchen - dining and living area with views out to the garden from the large windows. With stylish parquetry flooring this area is a great hub of the home. \n\nThe large kitchen with an oversized island bench space has an AEG oven and Miele induction cooktop along with great storage space. Adjacent to the living area is a stylish study nook complete with glass French doors and a view to the garden. \n\nThe 2nd and 3rd bedrooms are segregated from the main bedroom and both are of a good size with ample wardrobe space and good sized windows. \n\nThe master bedroom is a great size - with plenty of room for a king sized bed- and separated from the ensuite via stylish plantation shutters. The ensuite is oversized with deep bath as well as a good sized shower and vanity. There is also a spacious WIR with sliding door. \n\nThe main bathroom has a bath with combined shower to service the other two bedrooms. \n\nThis gorgeous apartment not only has lovely interiors but has a large fully fenced garden which any home owner would be proud of!
