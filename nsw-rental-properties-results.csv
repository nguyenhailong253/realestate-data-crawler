For years, locals lapped up everything the suburb had to offer. Now, the rest of us are learning what it’s all about – community, energy and really good food.\n\nAn up-and-coming inner-west gem, Petersham gives locals the best of both worlds. It’s just six kilometres from the CBD and close to Leichhardt, Dulwich Hill, Newtown and Marrickville. \n\nThis kind of accessibility is why young professionals and couples are moving into the area in droves – they have everything they need at their fingertips, and can easily commute to and from the city and the airport.\n\nPetersham is a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, all of which bring a sense of community and energy to the area. While there are plenty of retirees who have called the suburb home for decades, in recent years, more young professionals, couples and families have moved in. It seems to be the kind of place where everyone has an interesting story. Cultural diversity adds to the appeal of this inner-west neighbourhood. \n\n\nPetersham park is as iconic as it is beautiful. It’s been a fixture of the suburb for decades, and is now home to sporting grounds, playgrounds, BBQ and picnic areas, a bandstand, public pool and landscaped gardens. Petersham Park is a haven for parents. On Mondays, a community initiative called the Magic Yellow Bus visits the park to offer free activities for kids under five.
